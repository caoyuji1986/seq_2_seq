When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy patient.
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley, who was a Ph.D. in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
When Alex came to the first meeting, they wore jeans and busted-lined top, and she fell over to the sofa in my office, bulk up and told me she'd be there to talk about men's issues, but she would be there to talk about men's issues.
And when I heard that, I was relieved.
My classmates got a burning branch from the first patient.
And I got a woman in the '20s who wanted to talk about boys.
I got that one up, I thought.
But I didn't get it.
With the funny stories that Alex was involved in, it was easy for me to nodes simply pressing your head as we were in the world.
"30 is the new 20," said Alex and to estimate, they were right.
W later came later, marriage later, kids later, even death, he later came to death.
People in the '20s like Alex and I had nothing as a time.
But soon my advent was urging me to question Alex's life's love life.
I against it.
I said, "Yeah, she's been with men underneath her levels, she's sleep with a spaky head, but she won't marry him."
And my caregiver said, "No, but maybe she's married, but she's maybe married the next.
Also, the best time to work Alex' marriage is before they're married."
That's what psychologists call an "ha moment."
This is the moment when I realized that 30 are not the new 20th.
Yes, people are getting submerged to later in the day, but that didn't make Alex's 200s ain't development.
Alex was 200s into the optimal developing world, and we sat there and they were waste.
So I realized that this sort of harmless nearest problem with a realm of necklace was a real problem with just Alex and their love life, but it's the careers, families and people in the '20s and people in the '20s.
At this point, there are 50 million people in the United States at this point.
We're talking about about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent, if you don't have any adults, without leaving any adults.
raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I want to see a few of you.
Oh, yeah ⁇  You're all incredible.
If you're working with someone in the '20s, you love one in the '20s, I want to see you -- Great.k. Great. People in the 20s are really important.
I specialize in the 20s of the '20s, because I think that every single one of those 50 million people should know what psychologists and fruit boards are, and fecalists, the 20th-century requirement of the 20 islands, and yet, most of the things that you can do for work, for love, are happiness, perhaps even the world's happiness.
This is not my opinion. These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the most precise moments of time is happening in time.
That means that eight of 10 decisions, experiences and aha-hour, that your life is in the mid-'80s, it's until your mid-10s are already happening.
Don't be panic if you're about 40.
This group will be working well, I believe.
We know that the first 10 years of a profession is an exponential impact on how much money you make.
We know that 30 more than half of Americans have married, or with the future partner, or a relationship with the future partners.
We know that the brain is completely wired, and it's growing, and it's growing, and it's growing, and it's growing, and it's getting wired for adults to be wired, and that means that whatever you want to change to you, now the time it would be, the time it would be time to change you, it would be to do this.
We know that personality during 20 more is more likely to change than at some point in life, and the fertility of women at 28 is peaked at the peak, and that gets complicated.
So in the '20s, you should educate the body and your own possibilities.
When we think of the child's development, we all know that the first five years for language acquisition and engaging in the brain is critical.
It's time that ordinary, everyday life, has an excessive impact on the future.
But we hear very little bit about the fact that there is something like adult development and our 20s over a critical time.
But people don't hear me in the '20s.
The press is talking about the time of adulthood.
The '20s aended puberty by the 20s.
Journalists are thinking stupid nicknamed for people in the 20s, "Twonder," or "kids-down-down-down-down-down-the-down-down-beat."
It's true.
As a culture, we've trivialized that, now the critical decade for adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein predicted that big things come with a plan and a little bit of time.
Isn't that true?
So what happens when someone comes to the head and says, "You're going to take 10 years and say, "You're going to take 10 years to make something from your life?"
No.
There's a person who has been deprived of the ambition and urgency, and it's nothing.
And so every day, interesting people in the 20s, interesting people like her, or how like sons and daughters, who sort of say, "I know, my friend doesn't do me, my friend doesn't do me, but that relationship. I just want to beat out the time dead."
Or you say, "All I've done is, as long as I've done it at 30 years, my career is good."
But later it sounds like this: "My 20s are almost over and I have nothing to prove.
I had a better life cycle when I had just completed my college."
And then the sound is like, "In my 20s, parties like this take Jerusalem.
Everybody was running around, and they were having fun, then at 30, the music was completely coming, and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person standing, and sometimes I think sometimes I got married because in my 30s, I was the next chair in my 30s."
Where are people in the '20s?
Power is not.
OK, that's saying, but it's saying, but it's not making any mistakes, because it's all about a lot.
So, if a lot of the things have been over the '30s, there's a huge amount of pressure, in the '30s, a career to chick a city, a partner and two or three children in a much more interventional time period.
A lot of these things are incompatible, and what we find is just more and more reluctant, and the things that are being done, all at once in the '30s, are more crissible.
The Millennium Madelf crisis doesn't mean a red sports car.
It means that you don't want to make the career you want.
You'll notice that you can't have this child who you want to have, or can't give you sibling the child.
Too many people in the '30s and '40s, they look at themselves and say, "What was I doing here? What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what people in the 20s are doing and think.
This is a story that shows how we can run.
It's the story of Emma.
Emma came to my office, when she was 25, because she expressed it, an identity crisis.
She said she'd like to work in art or she's in an entertainment, and she hadn't decided, so she'd have been tortured over the past few years.
Because that was cheaper, she lived with her friend who made more his temperament than his own ambition.
And even though their 20s were tough, they were even worse in the years before.
She would often go in the session, but then she got to go and she said, "My family can't pick you, but you can't choose your friends."
Emma day, Emma came up with a very beaten up and he was crying for all the hours.
She had bought an address book, and she spent all the morning carving out of her lots and she'd staring down at the void, and she was going to go, "I emerged, you know, "I emergency."
She was almost hysterical when she looked at me and said, "Who will be there if I have a car crash?
Who will provide me if I have cancer?"
And at the moment, I had to pull together, not to say, "I'm going to be saying.
But Ema didn't need a therapist who really, really cares about them.
Emma needed a better life and knew, this was their chance.
I had actually wired a lot of my first patient Alex to just watch how Emas was coming in for a decade, in a rowing entitlement.
In the next weeks and months, I had Emma three advice that every 20-year-old, whether man or woman should have heard, should hear.
One, I told Emma, she would have no identity crisis, so they would go to a lot more like an identity capital.
And I went to see them do something that would keep them going.
Powerfulness that is an investment, you want to invest in something you want to be next.
I didn't know about Emmetas's vocal decline, and nobody knows what the future of work looks like, but I know if I'm using identity capital, I know.
So now is the time for this international job, this practice, this startups, this startups that you want to try.
I shame the 20s, by the way, those of the 20s, those who don't even try to make those, by the way, those are not a traveling circles.
That's procastation.
I said to Emma, the workforce, but do what it's like.
Second, I said, the urban landscape is overrated.
Good friends are primarily about to get to the airport, but 20, who's trying to with people who think they're like, who do they know, who they know, who they know, how they're doing, how they're working, how they're working.
This new thing, this new person, to the Earth, is mostly from outside the environment.
New things come out of so. "weaked Suns," therefore friends of friends.
It's true: half of the 20s is under business or not at all.
But the other half of it, it's not and weaked, and we have done that, and we have done that, in the other half,
Half of the jobs are never written down, so if you contact your neighbor, your neighbors are contacted, you don't get a job.
This is not a sea trick. This is spreading information.
The last advice: Emma believed that you can't go to the family, but you can't go to the friends.
This was true for her growing up, but as a 20th, she would soon find out your own family, if she had a partner and started a partner.
I told her time to go a new family, now that's where I'm going.
You might think it's 30 better than 20 or 25, and I agree with you.
But some of the things you're sleeping with or you live in your life, when everyone's married, your Facebook is not getting married.
The best time to plan your marriage is before you have got a severe, and that means to be a part of love, as you're in your work.
Your family has been able to choose, to deliberately search what you need, not because it works, or with some somebody who just deals you to me, or someone who you care has just been chosen.
So what did Emma do with Emma?
We went through her address book, and she found the resident of a cousin that was working in a museum in a different state.
This weak band, helped her, get a job.
This laboratory was gave her the reason for her friend who lived with her friend.
Now, five years later, they're an event maker for museums.
She married a man that she deliberately chosen.
She loves her new career and her new family, and she's sent to me a card, and she said, "Now, in the case of the crime, you don't adapt large enough."
Emma's history sounds like it's all easy, but that's what I love about 20-year-olds.
It's so easy to help them.
20-year-olds are like launchers who are just leaving airports and they are going to be giving back to the West.
It's like a small change to the launch, you can make a difference in Alaska, or in Fiji, for a small change.
This is equivalent to 21-foot equivalent, 25- or 29-year-olds, a great vacation, an inspirational TEDTalk, and that can have an enormous impact for over years and even through generations.
This is an idea that all of the 20s should be reached out.
It's as simple as what I said to Alex.
I've been privileged to say this 20s, to the '20s, 'The '30s,' '30s,' so you guys go up,'s he was using an identity capital, and use your faint banding to your family.
Don't tell you about what you're not knowing, or not.
You're just going to decide on your life.
Thank you.
In the entire computer story, it was always our goal, to deny the distance between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen, where we can live our imagination.
And this separation is smaller, smaller and smaller, and now it's smaller than one millimeter, the thicknesscrob, which is the thickness, and computers are accessible to everybody.
But I asked myself what it was like if there was no boundary at all.
So I imagined myself what this would look like.
So I've developed this tool, which goes into the digital world, and so if you press down it, it turns out it's a lot of pixeled world, and then it turns it into pixeline figure.
So, designers can materialize their ideas into three-dimensional and surgeons can get under the screen of virtual organs under the screen.
So with that tool, the boundary broke.
But our hands are still remaining outside the screen.
How do we intervene, and we can intervene with the digital information, and use all the skilledness of our hands?
Microsoft Applied, with my mentor Cati, with my mentor Cati Boul, redeemed the computer, and spoke a little space over the top of the keyboard.
And in a sense that a transparent screen and depth of the brain, with the fingers and the face of the fingers, can now be combined with the keyboard, now can now reach the 3D space, and start to reach the bare hands of the boards.
Because windows and files have a position in the actual space, they can choose so easily, how to use a book on a shelf.
Then you can flip through this book and mark the word and the words, all this time, all this virtual todra pad below the surface.
Architects can rotate their models straight into their two hands and rotate them.
So in these two examples, we reach into the digital world.
But what if we flip over the whole and then get digital information instead of what's happening?
Certainly, many of you have already heard the experience of being able to buy article and later give back.
But now you've got to worry about it.
Here I have an "On-African Innovation Scale."
and that's a vision of a brain that's got a head-on, or transparent display, when the system gets the geometry of our bodies.
And this idea, I started thinking, I began to think about the pixel not only in the space, but to make it physical, so that we could touch them and feel.
What would that future look like?
I coincidentally with my adviser Hirishi, with my adviser Hirishi Ishii, my collaborator Rayi Post, who created an real pixel.
Well, in this case, the magnet is the magnet like a three-dimensional pixel in our world, which means that computers, as humans, can move this object around -- at least in this tiny 3D space.
Essentially, we've switched gravity, we control the motion by using magnetic levitation, mechanical engineers, and these technologies, these technologies.
So by programming this object, we're free to pull it from the limits of space and time, so we can get human movements now, rendered human movements, and permanently, in the real world, are going to be permanent in the real world.
For example, Choreographs are being taught to be taught at a long distance, or Michael Jordans are famous again and they are being mimics back to the real world.
Students can use this to learn complex concepts like planetary movement and physics, and so different than computer screening or textbooks is this one real and pervasive experience, and it's very powerful that you can touch and feel powerful.
even more exciting than just the things we have right now in the computer, it's to be able to imagine how programming the world will actually change our daily activity.
As you can turn, digital information not only has something show up, but actually start interacting with us as part of our physical environment, without separating ourselves from our real world.
Today, we started by talking about the limits, but if we remove that border, the only border is our imagination.
Thank you.
I've been trained for two years to become a turner in Hunan, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first class, I wanted to send the government to a school for athletes, all the costs of the bust.
But my mother said, "No."
And my parents wanted me to be an engineer like them.
After living through Cultural Revolution, they found that the only way to happiness is a safe and good luck.
It's not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
This is me playing on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer, very early on, had to start acrobatics training, so I tried to get to the operations of presumption.
I even wrote in the school principal, and the host of a radio show.
But the adults, they didn't like my idea.
The adults didn't think I was serious about this.
Only my friends were supporting me, but they were also just children, as is no matter what I do.
And at 15 years old, I knew I was too old to start with training.
So my dream would never be true.
I was afraid that I could just make the rest of my life a good luck of two choice.
But it's so unrequited.
So I went in my head, and I found another calling.
No one to teach me to teach me? It's good.
So I turned to books.
I was still stumbling on my model by this book, and I was standing in an aftermath, and I was a family by my self-direction, and I was a my model of the self-confuer family, whereas the confident, "Before Lady" ⁇  I was inspired, "Before I've been anxiously self-efficient, I have to go study how much more I have to
 ⁇ "Sanmo Nanmo ⁇   ⁇ "Lections of Nan Huaijin in 1995, I got to the United States. And what books have I read about them?
Of course, books that are being banned in China.
"The good Earth is about the life of Chinese farmers.
This just isn't as good as propaganda. I understood.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
But that's a topic for another time.
But the fifth commandment I had to tear in a kind of epiphany, was, "You're going to have your father and your mother."
"Ehh," I thought, "That is so different and much better than obesity."
That was my way to liberate me from the confuction of Confucian guilt, and innovating relationship with my parents.
Through the encounter with a new culture, I started to read the comparative reading.
This is what many insights are.
I didn't find this map, for example, because Chinese students grew up with this one of these.
I never occurred to that in China that China has to be in the center of the world.
So a map says something about personalized view.
The comparative reading is nothing new.
In the academic world, it's a standard process.
There's even research, like comparison comparison, and comparison literary science.
Compared and opposite to other people enable a more complex understanding of the subject.
So I thought, if comparative reading in research, why not in life, is the same?
So I started reading two books at the same time.
You can be able to operate by people --  ⁇ Benjamin Franklin," from Walter Isaacson's "Look Adams" by David McCullough that was involved in the same event, or from friends with shared experiences.
 ⁇ "We print Snowledge ⁇   ⁇ "The Lowball" ⁇   ⁇ "The Learning Jews ⁇   ⁇ ath ⁇  Snowing the same stories of Katharine Children Bible, I am also the same stories in different genomes -- "Bible Bible Bible" -- or "Bible Bible Buffet -- or similar stories of various cultures," as in Joseph Campbell's
Christians, the attempts of economic, political, spiritual nature.
In Buddha, they were all psychological natural: lust, fear and social breakthrough -- interesting.
When you dominate a foreign language, it's also fun to read the favorite books in two languages.
 ⁇ "Sinfonite for a sake of Thomas Monton  ⁇   ⁇  "The Taocher water -- the Taoism Lifeness" from Alan Watt's "If" to lose me in the translation, I found out how much I could win by this.
For example, translation, I have granted, "Happiness" is "happiness" in Chinese literally "chunning "dollar".
"Brides" in Chinese, literally "newed Mother" to the "new Mother."
So, I think, as a magical gift, I have a magical gate to the people, but I have a connection to the past and the present.
I know that I'm never going to feel lonely or feel powerless.
A broken dream is really nothing compared to what many others have gone through.
I became convinced that it's not the only purpose of a dream to be true.
Its purpose is to bring us into intervention, where our passion is from where our passion and our happiness is coming from.
Even a broken dream can help meet this purpose.
Because books, I'm here today, are happy, again, with a purpose in life, and with a very clear view, most of the time.
Young books always be with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came in the class, and she was as impressive as new girls seem to be.
She had long been a brilliant hair and a little cute, and she was good at geography and they were in bookstairs.
I was rip-eating before jealousy in this year until I had a plan.
So I stayed a little bit longer at school one day and a lot longer, and hidden in the mabed bill.
When the air came in, I came out of the classroom, and I took a lot of the notebook from the teacher desk.
And then I did.
I rigged the notes of my rival, just a few A.
All Aerial.
And when I wanted to leave the book, I realized that some of my other classmates had a good grades.
So I corrected all the grades in the jealousy, no imagination.
I gave all the veterin's and myself, I was one of my lessons because I was here all the time.
I'm still hired about my behavior.
I don't understand where the thought came from.
I don't understand why I felt so good at this.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I've never been in favor.
It was so obvious.
I never really ever caught up.
But the thing that amazes me is, why did it vote so much that this little girl was so good at the bookstore?
Beh-ealer's just stunning me.
It's so mysterious, it's profound.
We know babies are suffering from jealousy.
Similarly primates, as primates, are very fragile in nature.
We know that jealousy is the main reason for murder amongst spotlers in the U.S.
But I never read a study that could explain to me their loneliness, their loneliness, or their makablar.
And this is a moment where we have to go through the literature, because the novel is the laboratory that was analyzed in all of their possible forms.
Is there an exaggeration to say that if we had no jealousy, we had no literature?
So unrequited Helena, no Odyssey.
Not an egoing king, not " adventure from 1001 night."
No Shakespeare.
So, the U.S. students, the U.S. students, are saying, "Look, the same thing," the big, "Gatsby" is, "Madame Bovary," "Anna Karenina."
No jealousy, no one. I know that's in fashion, and I know that the Prost has got the answer to everything, but it's in fact a dedicated sense.
This year, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of his masterpiece, "Afoute the lost time" and its great analysis of sexual jealousy and normal competition, my thing, my thing, we can have hope.
Let's think about it, think about feelings, think about feelings, right?
We think of the young boys that are trying to sleep.
We're thinking about a tile of cake, in the Librandula.
We forgot about how he was doing his vision.
We forgot how cruel it is.
Those kinds of books are for Virginia Wolf as a pharmaceutical company.
I don't know what a pharmaceutical company is, but let's say it's impressive.
Now let's see why the novel and the jealousy, the jealousy and the self-sufficiency,
Is it so obvious that jealousy is reduced to person -- clubs -- obstacles, such a toughest platform to a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard at the pain of pain, because think of what happens when we jeopardize what happens when we get jealous.
When we are jealous, we tell a story.
We tell ourselves stories about other people's lives, and they're doing things that we're really bad at because they're designed to do so.
As a narrator of the story, the audience, we know what details it to hold to the knife, right?
jealousy makes you all amateur robotic cars, and it Probably is a question.
In the first band, "In Sweeney, in the Romanic, Sweeney, the protagonist, very loving his loved ones -- are in the bed, and suddenly, in a course, a sentence -- "Better" -- so the idea is, they're as long as rivers, they're so narrow, and they're going to be like, "Wait a second, have anyone love
All they're willing to do and enhance joy, could also prepare someone else's joy, maybe even at this moment."
This is the story he told himself, and from there, that is, when he wrote a question, Snowman's heights he added to his loved ones, to his "Internal Civato Torture," to add in his private Torturekammer.
We have to admit that Sann and Profess are not a viable grade.
Profession's friends had to rely out if they had to end up trying to get the conclusion.
But you don't need to be jealous with this to leave a contract, it's hard work. Right?
Eifeating is tiring.
It's a hungry feeling that needs to be nurtured.
What likes the jealousy?
And jealousy likes information.
And jealousy like details.
Being for jealousy is long been a brilliant hair and little cute bit.
And jealousy might be photographed.
So instagram is so successful.
Basically, the language of science connects to the language of science and the jealousy.
When Snowman experiences up this jealousy, suddenly the door, and the services of his loved ones, he's denied of his loved ones, he's defending this behavior.
He says, "You think that's a abstract thing to think about, but it's nothing else to interpret an ancient text, or look at a monument."
He says, "There are scientific investigations with real intellectual value."
Profession is trying to show us that jealousy is unbearable and we look silly, but at its core it's a search for knowledge, after truth, the painful truth and the value of a matter of proposition: the more painful, the better.
Chief, humility, loss -- it's for the sake of wisdom.
He says, "A woman we need to suffer from, unlocks us a larger and wider range of emotions than the genius of a man's genius, who's interested in us."
Is he telling us that we want to look for horrible women?
No. I think he's trying to tell us that the jealousy is to tell us something about ourselves.
Is there any other feeling that we open ourselves in this particular way?
Does anybody remove our aggression, our hidden ambition and our clothes?
Does anyone feel anything else about this kind of weird intensity?
Freeud should be able to write about it later.
One day, Freud came out of a very eco-d young man who was concerned about the idea that he was perceived his wife.
And Freud says, "Here's kind of weird," because he doesn't even see what his wife is doing.
Because she's innocent, and everyone knows this.
The poor critter is being suspended.
Instead, he's looking at things that his wife does not notice without real, unobsurvising behavior.
Smiling them too much or does she like to have a man?
 ⁇ Breud ⁇  said the man become the heter of the underside of his wife.
The novel is very good at this point.
The novel sees very well, jealousy, as a way of jealousy, but doesn't look very much like it.
Because the more jeopardy we are, the more we draw in imaginations.
So I think jealousy is not making us to do violent or illegal things.
Eifeza makes you feel very creative.
I think with eight years, but also the story I've heard about in the news.
A 52-year-old woman from Michigan was arrested because they built a year of a self- built false Facebook account for a year of nasty, disagreement on itself.
For a whole year.
She was trying to slice her ex-boyfriend into the shoes, and I admoned it, when I heard that, I reacted with admiration.
Because, let's be honest.
Which, unhealthy, as deplaced, creativity. Right?
This is something from a novel.
This is from a novel of Patricia Highsmith.
Highsmith is one of my favorite writer.
She's the most brilliant and strange woman of literature.
This is, "To strangers in the train," and "They," all books, "The Talented Mr. Ripley," all books that are acting like jealousy, and we're all excited, and we're at this realm of jealousy, in the membrane between what is, and what could be, in a moment, what could be been through.
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
So, first of all, what Tom Ripley is, and what you have, he's got you and what you've got, and you've got to be like the floor, and you're going to have the floor, and he's on your name, he's carving your jewelry, and you're going to run your bank account.
That's a method.
But what are we supposed to do? We can't make it as Tom Ripley.
I can't give the whole world to be free, even though I'd like to do it for some days.
It's a shame because we live in an awful lot.
We live in a business-faying stone.
We're all good citizens of social media, where the currency is envy. Right?
Does the novelty show up? I'm not sure.
But if we do what characters do when they're not certain, they're not safe to own a puzzle.
Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask him to Sherlock Holm.
People in Holm, think of the people, think about his Nemesis as a professor, this brilliant criminal.
But I still like the  ⁇ Internal ⁇  Lewel, the head of Scotland Yard with the face of a rat, the Holmes, the Holmes, it needs him, it's migrating him, but it's migrating him.
So I've got that familiar.
So, Modes needs his help, sets him and swings it over the course of the stories to be built with the kinds of things.
But as it collaborates, and ultimately, the six Napole is beginning to change, and ultimately, "The Six Napoleon" is coming in, and all of us are rotating, turning to Holmes and saying, "We're not envying you, Mr. Holmes. Holmes.
We are proud of you."
And he adds that there was no Scotland yard, the Sherlock Holm, the hand shaking hand.
This is one of the few times that we see Holmes in his stories, and I think that's very moving, but also mysterious, but also mysterious, right?
It doesn't seem to be an emotional, but it doesn't seem to be a physical problem.
In a moment, Holmes is on another wavelength of Lego.
And the next moment, they're at a wavelength.
Suddenly it lets you admire Legen that he's been committed to doing this kind of genius.
Is it really that easy?
What if jealousy was really only a physical problem if it was just about what we were doing with the other in relation?
Maybe we wouldn't have to use someone's excellence.
We can do a lot of each other.
But I like emergency plans.
While we wait for it, we still have literature than consoling.
Literature alone is equipped to jealousy.
Literature alone can pinch it, invites it.
And who's got it all together: the good Lew, the fear-type of Tom Ripley, the crazy Sann, Marcel Aust itself.
So we have a society.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old and on a camping trip with my father in the Adir Botox Mountain, a wilderness area in the northern part of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was gaining.
The sun would be shipping the leaves, and if there were a path of color, and if there were no path, that would almost have been the first people to go through this forest.
We came to our initial place.
I saw the little hut on a cliff and look over a crystal cliff, beautiful lake, and I fell something horrible.
Behind the roof, there was a trashcan, maybe four square meters, with apple cerms, collapsed aluminum foil, and an old license.
I was astounded, I was angry and confused.
The tents were too lazy to take away what they had brought from -- who did they think, would you?
And so the question he asked me, and I generalized them.
What's the spaces of us?
How do you turn it around, or where the "uns are," as well as that, who's in Istanbul?
Who's going to get in Rio? Or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York, we're in about 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recycling techniques.
I wanted to know them -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does the job.
What is it to carry on a uniform and to carry these burden?
So I started a research project with them.
I was driving in the truck, ran out the route, interviewed people in office and facilities in the whole city, and I learned a lot, but I was still a student.
I had to go deeper.
So I took a job as a cleaning power pill.
I didn't just drive the trucks. I got the trucks.
And I did the mechanical beasts and flooded the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an exciting experience.
They ask me after the smell.
It's there, but it's not present how you think, and days where it's really bad, you get very used to it.
The weight is always very difficult.
I know people who did this job for several years, and the body always adjusts for the weight they were to put their body up tons of garbage every week.
Then there's the danger.
After statistics of the Department of Department, the city was the job in the 10 most dangerous jobs in the country, and I learned why.
You're all day in traffic, everything is going to be over.
They want to keep everyone, and often not the car drivers,
That's really bad for workers.
And the waste itself is full of poison due to the char truck and horrible.
I also learned about the disbelief of the trash.
If you go from the side of the Bord Ecred and you see a city of the trash truck, you realize that garbage is like a natural rape.
He keeps understanding.
It's also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
He always has to be in motion.
And then the stigma.
You give up uniform and become invisible, until someone -- whatever reason is mad, because they're blocking the car, or at a breakthrough, they're blocking the car, or at a time they're drinking a coffee in their locally, and they come in and they're hoisting and saying that they want to have one of them on their own.
I find this stigma specifically ironic, because I believe that the employees of city are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, that has three reasons.
They are the public's public health.
If they didn't remove the trash, every day efficient and effective, he would be squeezed out of the jaw, and the perk of that dangle would be a very real path.
Well, we think, for decades and centuries, we'd have been in control, and we'd spread and harm.
The economy needs them.
If we cannot throw the old stuff out, we don't have a room for the new ones, the nurses of the economy are starting to starve when consumption is outbreaked.
I'm not applying capitalism, I'm not only showing up on the interrelation.
And then that's what I call our average, what's called an ordinary, mundane speed.
And I just mean how fast we are used to motion in this day.
We're not careful about our coffee cup to repair our pocket or our water bottle, or to clean up or to contribute.
We take them away, throw them away, forget them, because we know there are people on the other side that care about this.
So today, I'm going to suggest a few ways how we can think about how we improve stigma and how to bring about this conversation, how to create a city that is sustainable and human.
Their work, I think, is sort of liturgical.
You see the roads every day, regularly.
They have a lot in many cities.
You know when you're expecting to be.
And their work is what we're doing.
They're like reversing insurance.
The cycle that keeps them up is keeping us safe in front of ourselves, in terms of your department, the outcomes, and that this process has to be sustained at all costs.
At the days after 9 ⁇ 11, I heard the thunder of a carpenter in the street, my little son and ran down the stairs and ran down the stairs and there was a man who was driving his paper recycling around him, as he did every Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him for his work -- that day of all days, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and nodded, and he said, "All's good."
"All's good."
And it wasn't until later, I started my research, about towning and meticing the man.
His name is Paul and we often worked together, and we became good friends.
I wanted Paul to believe that Paul got right.
Everything will be good.
But in our struggle to change the way we live on this planet as a species, we have to keep all the costs at the cost of the human cost, including the very human cost of labor.
And we have to be informed, to be able to do the people that are doing this work, to think about how we're able to develop systems for sustainability, which is a remarkable success, across the U.S. success, over the last 40 years, about the United States of America and countries of the world, and we're looking at a horizon, where we're looking at other kinds of waste and industrial vents that can reduce that, and industrial
The urban trash, what we think we think about is rubbish, three percent of the national waste streams.
It's a remarkable statistic.
In your life, in your life, when you see someone who is a good job it's to be cleaned up to be clean, take a moment to perceive it.
Take a moment to thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?
That's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?
My name is Maysoon  ⁇ ayid, and I'm not drunk, but the doctor is already born.
He cut my mother six times into six different directions, and he made me feel the air.
That's why I have an infantile cerebral pairing, which means I'm going to give all the time to time.
Look at this.
It's exhausting. I am a cross-section of Shakira, Shakira and Muhammad Ali.
Cerebral Police is not genetically.
It's not birth defects. You can't get it.
No one has the uterus of my mother's utterity, and I won't get it because my parents cousin's first cousin.
You only get through accidents like the one that happened on my birthday.
I have to warn you. I'm not a source of that inspiration, and I don't want anyone to have any here with me, because you've all dreamed of being disinfected with a dot in your life.
Suddenly it's a very short story.
It's at the mall before Christmas in the shopping mall. You rotate bubbles, you see a parking lot, and what you see is you?
15, six empty disabled plots.
And you think, "How can I not be disabled?"
Now I must tell you, I have 99 problems and cerebral palsy is just one of those.
If there's an Olympics of oppression, I'm going to give a gold medal.
I'm Palestinians, Muslim, female, disabled, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better now, I don't know.
Cliff'side park in New Jersey is my hometown.
I love the fact that my dissolve and where the same initiative is the same initiative.
Similarly, I love the fact that I could walk from my house to New York City if I wanted to.
A lot of people don't walk with CP, but my parents didn't think they had a "known-"
The mantra of my father was, "Yeah, you can make this ⁇  You can go."
So if my three older sisters mad, I wiped out.
When my three elder sisters went to a public school, my parents complained the school system so that I could go and get all the war, and if we didn't get all the war, we would overlook the Pantomatoes of my mother.
My dad taught me how to walk when I was five, by putting my finger on your feet and just staying around.
Another of the Tacti was to make a dollar bill in front of my nose so I'll start it.
My inner striped stripper is very strong, and -- yes, the first day in kindergarten, I was like a champion, which had one too much off.
At that time, there were only six Arabs in my town, and they were all my family.
Today, we have 20 Arabs in the city, and they're all my family.
I think nobody has ever been realized that we are not Italians.
This was before 9 ⁇ 11, and before politicians were saying it was appropriate for them to use Muslims as a presumption of the electoral competition.
The people I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
But I was worried that I could maybe starve to Ramadan.
I explained to them that I could live from my body fat three months, so the highest upset, the sunrise, was a child's game.
I was browning Broadway.
Yes, Broadway, Broadway.
My parents could not afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the ballroom school.
I learned how to deny on the intents, so I can run to the intent.
And I am from Jersey, where it's really important to be chic, when my girlfriend is, I'm going to deny.
And when my friends were sitting on the shore of Jersey, they were going, I don't know.
I spent my summer in a war area because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine every single summer, one day, one day, Madonna.
The summer holidays often found that my father, who wanted me to cure the dairy of deceived, was got a lot of junk, was taken into the Dead Sea, and I remember the water in the eyes and I remember the water in the eyes, and I thought, "It ⁇ s working ⁇ "
But we found a miracle. We found, yoga, this.
I must say it's really boring, but before I do yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who's not even standing up.
So now I can stand up on the head.
My parents always blown up that I was going to be able to have a dream, and my dream was to be able to play a gerial, the soap operating general hospital.
Basically, the promotion of minority, I got a great scholar at the ASU, Arizona State University, because I trust every minority.
And I was sort of the household tenor of the acting day.
And everyone loved me.
I didn't do all the homework of these smart kids, got into all my Kesese Aes, got all these Kes Lesters, all their Kesen A.
Every time I played a scene of glass for "The glass of glass," they were hating my teachers.
But I never got a role.
At the age of my graduate, the ASU, which is a piece that has been called "The Sievan Department of Jackson,"
A play about a girl with CP.
I was a girl with CP.
So I was telling all over, "I'm going to get a role ⁇ 
I have cerebral palsy ⁇ 
Finally free, release.
Thank God, I'm finally free of that ⁇ "
I didn't get the role.
Sherry Brown got the role.
I cried the head of the acting; I crystalized as if someone had shot my cat, and I asked them why. They told me they didn't get to do the stunted, they were going to get the stunt.
I said, "Sorry, but if I don't know the stunts, the characters can't do it."
I was born for this role, and they gave it an actor without CP.
It was university-important.
Hollywood is very known to let you play healthy actors, physically, of course.
Then I went back home, and my first role as a statist was to a soap operator.
My dream came true.
And I knew that I would go from "Smarantgast" to "making my best friend."
But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture that was only detectable in the back of the mind, and I realized that the Casting principle directors were not a loose, ethnic, disabled actor.
They just hooked people up.
But exceptions, of course, tell us the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Bar ⁇ s and I had all these women in one thing in common: they were comicists.
So I became comic.
My first job was to drive a famous comic book from New York City to show in New Jersey, and I'll never forget, when I first started, the face of the first comics book, when he realized that he was in the street, Jersey, with a skull, with CP as a driver.
I've been upsetting in clubs everywhere, I've done some shows in the Middle East in Arabic, uncertainty, uncertainty.
Some people say, I'm the first comician in the Arab world.
I don't like to call myself the first, but I know that they're never heard by the bad guys, that women are not funny, and they feel like we're in a strange way.
In 2003, my brother had a mother and father, Dean Oldallah, with the New Yorker Arabic comedy, and I'm with the New Yorker Comedy Festival that now celebrates his 10-year-old.
And our goal was to change the negative image of American originally in the media, and also to the Casting principle, that South Asia and Arabia are not synonymous with the Arabia.
Araising of Arabs was far, far less simply, than the challenge to deal with the stigma of disability.
My big breakthrough was in 2010.
I was invited as a guest on the newscast, "Countdown Whate Keith Keith Libman."
I came to the closing ball, and they screwed me into a studio, and I sat down on a turning chair with roles.
So I looked at the stage manager, and I said, "Sorry, can I have another chair?"
And she looked at me and said, "Five, four, three, two ..."
And we were live ⁇ 
So I had to stick in the table at the table, so I didn't have to roll the scene from the face of the slide, and when the interview was over, I was out of myself.
There was my opportunity, and I had them failing, and I knew, they never invited me.
But Mr. Olberman invited me not only to come back, but to a full-time fellow, and glued my chair.
working with Keith Libman's work, I learned something good, so every people on the Internet are drawn down.
People say children are cruel, but as a child or adult, nobody ever made me funny.
In the World Wide Web, I'm with my disability suddenly, suddenly.
And when I look at online video, I see comments like, "Ey why does it come to this?"
"Ey, is that clip?"
And my favorite, "Arm Hen Fist.
Does she have disease?
We'd better pray for them."
One of the reasons I actually suggested to disability is to record my disability in those Credits: scripture, comicin, cerebral palsy.
A disability is visible as the origin.
If a wheelchair driver doesn't play Beyonc, it can play a wheelchair user, doesn't play a wheelchair user.
The disability is the biggest -- yes. That's an applause; Go.
People with disability are the biggest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresent in the entertainment industry.
The doctors said, I can't walk, but I'm sitting here in front of you.
But I would have grown up with social media, maybe not at all.
I hope that we can put together a positive picture of disability in the media and everyday life.
Maybe there would be less hatred on the Internet if there were more positive models.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it's still a village to raise a child well.
My journey has taken me to a very special place.
I used to run a red carpet with a soap operating Star Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus.
I was to play a film with Adam Sanders, and with my idol, who's working on wonderful Dave Matthews.
I am the character with the comedy "Ara Gone Wild" for the world.
I was a representative of the great state of New Jersey in Democrat in the Democrat in 2008.
I founded "Maybe's Kids Kids" a charity that tries to give the Palestinian refugees giving a fractive chance of giving me a shoutp.
But the one moment that most proclifies out -- before this one -- -- the moment, the most important, is when I first arrived in front of the man who's flown like a butterfly and like a bee, and he's got a bee darn, and just she's scraped up like me, like me, and he's like me, "Muhammad Ali.
That was the only time my father ever saw a live juvenile performance of me, and I dedicate this talk to him.
Meaning God your soul, daddy, daddy. My name is Maysoon  ⁇ ayid, if I can, you can do it as well."
There was a time when we solve big problems.
On July 21st, 1969, Buzz Aldrin came out of the Moonlands Found, and he went down to the sea of the quiet and he left the sea of the quiet.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their present, grayed, mooned interface, was the culmination of a permanent, communal pursuit.
The Apollo program was the largest peacekeeping in the history of the United States of America.
To get to the moon, invested NASA is about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the households of the household.
Apollo created jobs for 400,000 people, and required collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
Humans died, including Apollo 1, too.
But until the end of the Apollo program, 24 people went to the moon.
Of the 12 that are actually describing his surface, Alldrin, after the death of Armstrong, is now the oldest.
But why did they do?
They didn't bring much back, 380 kilogrammiters and something, which every 24 came out of our home, a new sense that our home is small and fragile.
Why did they go?  ⁇ ynthroposit ⁇   ⁇ ynchically they went because President Kennedy had to show the Soviet rockets that his nation had better rockets.
But Kennedy's own words in Rice University, at Rice University, give up a better hint.
For contemporary, Apollo is not just a victory of the West during the Cold War.
At the time, the most powerful feeling was a sense of wonder about the supernatural forces of technology.
They went to the moon, because it was something great.
Monage land was being run from a commentary a long Serge to technology triumph.
For the first half of the 20th century, the merchandise came along and the plane, penicillin and vaccine against Tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, polio and smallpox had been killed.
Technologies had something to have called Alvin Toffor, in 1970, called a "bliminalenial."
For most of human history, we could not get faster than a horse or a boat with sailing, but in 1969, the team of the Apollo 10 fleet flew the team of about 40, 40, and a couple thousand kilometers per hour.
Since 1970, no human beings have been more on the moon.
No one has moved faster than the Apollo 10, and the unhappy optimism about the power of technology is being evaporated, because the big problems we have with technology -- the big problems that we have to solve, for example, to fly clean energy, or to cure the world of starvation, or to rip the world of starvation, seem impossible to see.
And I remember, I'm a five-year-old.
Put the pool of Apollo 17 and my mother had not been able to look at it in a stable pup of Saturn V rocket.
I had an idea that this was the last Moon mission, but I was 100 percent sure that there was going to be a colon in my life Mars.
The exit called " something was happening to have big problems with technology, and it became a plot to solve it.
You hear it everywhere.
We've heard it here in the last two days at TED.
It's pretended that, as we had to refer technological science, we referred to the brain toys, things like iPhones and apps and social media, or algorithms, or algorithms, which are accelerating automatic business.
It's not something wrong with most of these things.
They've extended our lives and stored.
But it's not the big problems of mankind.
What has happened?
There's a lower explanation from Silicon Valley where you say that, in a long time, a few ambitious companies were nurtured for the years that Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech, were funded.
In Silicon Valley, you say the markets, they're guilt, they're barely the premium of the risk-taking.
Silicon Valley says that risk-taking is not going to move away from the world-changing ideas and instead of foster-producing problems or even foster problems.
But I'm not good enough with that explanation.
It basically explains what Silicon Valley is not true of.
Even at risk-related causes, risk-taking are these little facilities that are small facilities in the investment of 10 years.
Investors have always had a lot of cute in technologies to invest in technologies like energy, which is an enormous quality, and develop a lot of time, and risk investors, never finance, never finance the development of technologies, but the big problems, without the immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can solve big problem solving is complicated and profoundly more profound.
Sometimes we decide not to fix the big problems.
We could fly to Mars, if we want to.
NASA has already designed a design of this.
But to be able to fly Mars is a political decision of public popularity, and therefore it's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things here on the planet that need to be done.
Another time, we can't solve big problems because our systems are failing.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption of the Earth is going to be advanced, renewable sources, like solar energy, wind and biocolitics, and the reason for that is economic.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar energy and wind, and oil is cheaper than biofuels.
We all want to have alternative energy sources that can't keep up, but they don't exist.
Now it is that, in the case of business leaders, business leaders and economics, they are all the same opinion that the national practice of alternative energies and international deals is going to propose, mainly, an undergrading growth in science and development of energy technologies and an increased price of carbon.
But in the current political climate there is no hope that the energy policy of the United States or the international deals of the world or the international deals are going to be abundant.
Sometimes these are deep problems that have been solvable, that have come technically soluble.
It was long believe that famines were at the failure of food supply.
But 30 years of research taught us that famine, political crisis, had disastrous effects on the food distribution.
Compassion can do things like retrofits and systems like storage and transportation, but there's famine that's going to give you famine as long as there's some money.
And finally, a lot of problems have sometimes deprived of the solutions because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon told us that we were a bit resilient in 1971, but we found that there are many kinds of cancer that are most frequently resilient for the treatment of therapy, and for the last 10 years, an effective, realistic therapy of the last 10 years.
Difficult problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems with technology.
We can, but, but have to be there, have to be -- four elements of politicians, and the public has to be very interested in the public to be interested in working a problem; institutions need to support the solution; it really needs to be a technical problem; and we need to understand it.
The Apollom mission, which became a sort of metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, filled these criteria.
But this is a model where, in fact, what you can't repeat in the future is a model of the future.
It's not 1961.
There is no dramatic fight like the Cold War, no politicians like John Kennedy, who's making anything difficult and dangerous to a hero, and no popular science fiction, like the exploration of the solar system.
but most of all, it was just easy to fly to the moon.
It was three days away.
And it's a disk that really has solved a serious problem.
We are ourselves and the solutions are going to be more difficult to reach in the future.
God knows that we don't miss the challenge anyway.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
So imagine you're standing in front of your door.
Look at the door, and her color, and the material she's made of.
And you get to see a group of overweightK KKK-ler on their bicycles.
It's a naked bicycle run, and they come right up to you and your doorstep.
You have to really imagine it.
They're bulging off, sweating and craving the right to you.
And then they took all of them into your house.
Bicycles, wheels, everything moves, everything moves, and spores in preparation.
Now, it turns out that the door of your apartment in your own hurry is your own hallway, or what you at the other side of your door, and you enjoy it, and you enjoy the light in the space.
The light comes on the Cookie Monster.
It declines you're coming from the back of a yellow-brag.
You have a talking horse.
You can almost feel like yours are tickling your nose.
You smell the cookie, it's in your mouth, and it's shutting down.
So fucked up over, over in your living room.
So here you are with the performance of your imagination Britney Spears.
Their clothes cover only the most everything, she's singing, "Hit More Time," as it's on your living room table.
Now this is followed to your kitchen.
The soil was replaced by a yellow Pand-Aid road, and from your even-mastery, you get Dorothy, the Voiceinian cubicle, the lion of "The County Celler Oz," "Man, hand in hand, and hob it."
OK. Now, the eyes open.
I'm going to tell you about a very bizarre competition that was being held every year in New York City.
It's called "Untitled Memory Championship."
A few years ago, I was going to report to this competition as science journalist, and I expected to find the anniversary of the islands of the islands.
It was a bunch of guys, and a few quadripes of it, from a very different age and a hygienestic standpoint.
They just presented to a looking at random numbers of random numbers.
Learning the names of dozens and dozens of unknowns.
And I realized that in just a few minutes, you get this whole poem.
They competed for the order of a mixed-suffic castle for the order of a mixed cardiac.
This is crazy.
And these people have to have supernatural abilities.
I started talking to some of them.
This is Ed Cok, a guy who came here from England, and there's a brain of persistence.
And I asked him, "Ed, when did you notice that you have this particular voyage?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an islandic selection.
I just have an average memory.
Everyone who's done this will tell you that he or she has only a average memory.
We all, using it using an old technique, are technician techniques to execute these amazing memory pieces of memory, techniques that the Greeks have invented about the same techniques that Cicero used to be used to learn to learn its testing memories, and the medieval scholars to learn how to use full books is a memorial scholar."
And I just thought, "Wow, how come I've never heard of it?"
We were standing outside of the competition and Ed, this wonderful, brilliant, brilliant, and some excerpt, they said, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney Spears?"
I said, "What? Neep. Why?"
"I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to use the order of a mixed cardias, U.S. TV.
This would prove everybody's guesses this is everybody."
I told him, "I'm not Britney Spears, but you could teach me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, right?"
And it was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I spent most of the next year working on my memory, but I was not spending my memory studying it, but to understand it, how it works, and how it works and what its potential might be.
I've met a lot of really interesting people.
So here is E.P.
It suffers, probably, to the world's worst memory, and probably the worst memory of the world.
His memory is so bad that he doesn't even remember your memory problem. What is amazing?
Though it was so tragic, he offered insights in how much our memory made out who we are.
On the other side of the spectrum, I learned.
Kim Peek.
He was the facility of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man" in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent an afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, to learn a little bit about the public libraries. Just really fascinating.
And I came back to read a entire stack of treatments about memory, negotiations that were written 2,000 years ago and more in Latin and later in the Middle Ages.
And I've learned a whole bunch of really interesting things.
Especially, I intrigued that there was a time when the idea of training to train memory, to discipline memory, was not nearly as alien, as it was today.
There was a time when people invested in their memory, they wanted it to be on their own.
Over the last few millennia, we've invented a number of technologies -- from the alphabet, to the codex, the book, the photographer, the computer, the smartphone -- that made it easier to store our memory, to store our memory, to the fundamental human spirit, that we can essentially deny this fundamental human capacity.
And these technologies have enabled our modern world, but also changed at the same time.
They have changed us cultural, and I would argue that they have changed cognitively.
Without the necessity of remembering, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how it's done.
One of the last places on Earth, where you can still find people who are still passionate about memory, discipline their memory and cultivate it, is that unique memory competition.
In fact, it's not so unique; it's competition like this all over the world.
And that drawn me off the ban, I wanted to know how these guys do this.
Several years ago, a research group at University of London brought together a group of memory in the lab.
They wanted to know, is the structure or anatomy of their brain different from the rest of us?
And the answer was no.
Are they smarter than us?
They gave them a stack of cognition tests, and the answer was, Actually, not.
But there was a interesting and sectarian difference between the brain of a memory and a control person that was compared to that.
When you put them into an fMRI machine, and you scan their brain scanning, they're taking numbers, faces and images of snowflakes, you can see that in the brain, in the brain, they are lighting up other areas of the brain as the rest of us are lighting.
It's that they'd be used to part of their memory that's used for spatial errors and navigation.
Why? And can we learn something else?
The competition is the best memory competition, which is dominated by a kind of arms race, where every year, with a new technique, a whole lot of facts have been trumped and the rest of the rock is needed.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-dimensional world champion.
On the table before front, 36 mixed cards is 36 mixed cards that he invented within an hour with a technique that he's been invented and a lot of.
He used a similar technology to imprison the accuracy order of 4, 140 random binomes in half an hour.
Yeah.
And although there's an enormous amount of techniques to implement all of the different things that we're trying to fight in, all of these techniques are based on the concept that psychologists call "the field of coding."
So we've called the baker ⁇ Baker Padox illustration that this is a concept that follows this particular concept, which is the case I ask two people to remember the same word, and I say, "Make sure there's a person called the baker."
That's his name.
And I say, "Make sure there's a person that's a baker."
So if I come back to you a later time, and I say, "You're going to say the word I said you had said a while back?
Do you know what word it was?"
The person that was going to memorize the person we want to see is less likely to be the word as the person who is to reject the person with the trees, and to have a cuter,
Same word, different memory; that's strange.
What's going on here?
Well, the name of the Baker doesn't mean you're doing anything.
It's absolutely independent of all the pieces of memory that are swirling in your head.
But the job of the baker, we know the baker.
Takers are wearing these strange white blaks.
Theakers are flourishing at their hands.
Takers smell well when they come home from work.
Maybe even a baker is wearing a baker.
And when we hear the word first, we associate these associations with the word and enable the memory to come back to the later.
The secret of what's going on in memory fighting and the secret to drawing merits possible is to find a way to keep the name of the baker, which has no association and meaning to turn the name of baker into the job of being connected to a sort of memory fight, neither in terms of meaning, in a way, to change meaning and to have a sense of memory, that they have existed in the previously existing memory
One of the more sophisticated techniques for this is actually been due to the ancient Greeks of Greeks.
It was known as the memory palace.
So the story of his creation goes like this: There was a poet called Simonia, he went to a feast.
It was a conversation to the entertainment, because at that time, if you wanted to shoot a really big parties, you didn't have a D.J.; you had a poet.
He carries his poem out of memory and leaves the space, and at the moment, the hall is breaking down and buried all the guests.
Not all of them are dead, their bodies are not designed to uncertainty.
No one can tell you who was there, no one knows where you got.
The body cannot be asked properly.
It's one tragedy after another.
Simonides are standing out there, the only survivor of this disaster, he's closing his eyes, and suddenly he's realizing that he in his mind can see in front of his inner eye, where he's sitting.
And so he removes the removed by hand, and she's carrying them through the debris for the deceased.
And in this moment, Simoni's understood something we all know is that we all know how bad we can also remember names, phone numbers, or what we can do to a our colleagues, we have a very good visual and spatial memory.
If I asked you to do the first 10 words of the story about Simoni, it's a lot of time to be a lot of it.
But I bet if I asked you to remember who at this moment sitting on a speaking yellow ball of yellow, you could visualize this problemlessly, you know, this problem.
The idea of memory palace is to build a building in your mind, and it's playing with images of the stuff -- the crazy, bizarre, bizarre, funnier, you're the more fun, the stinking of the picture is, the way it's pictureed, the stronger it can be.
This is a advice that goes back over 2,000 years old latinistic texts about memory.
So how does it work?
So imagine you invited to keep a talk at TED, and you had to keep it from memory, just like Cicero did it, so he would have to invited TEDxRome to be invited 2,000 years ago.
You could do this, imagine your doorstep in front of you.
You give an absolutely crazy and distinct story with a unfamiliar story to remind you that you want to talk about this crazy competition.
And you'll go into your house, and you're going to see the Cookie Monster on the back of Mr. Ed.
And that would remind you to imagine your friend Ed Cok.
And if you see Britney Spears, you remember a funny anecdote that you wanted to tell.
You go into your kitchen, and the fourth thing you want to talk about is this strange journey that you have gone for a year, and you have some friends who help you remember this strange journey.
This is how Roman speakers realized their pronunciations -- not word for word, but it just confused them.
The English term, "topic shorthand," which is the subject ofic shrimp, comes from the Greek word "topos."
These are remains of when people think about adequate and rhetoric in the gift of sort of clear terms.
The formulation, "The first place," is called, "To your memory."
And I just found this fascinating and I'm still.
We had to keep a couple of other memory fights.
I wanted to write a little bit about this subculture of the competing book.
But there was a problem.
The problem is that these memory fighters are deadly sales of events.
It's like a group of people who are sitting there and writing a test.
It's exciting when someone's driving the sleep.
I'm a journalist, I need something that's worth writing.
I know that the breathtaking things in the minds of these guys are going to happen, but I don't have access to them.
So if I wanted to tell that story, I had to use myself in their position.
And so, I started getting 15 to 20 minutes every morning before I sat in with my newspaper to learn something memorial.
Maybe a poem.
I mean, I bought this name from an old year book that I bought at the Flash.
I found it was amazing to be a lot of fun.
I never could imagine it.
It's been fun because it's not about training memory.
You'd like to get better and get better at this, these crazy, colorful, dirty, funny, hopeful things in your your eye.
I really deeply into it.
Here I am with my standard, defeating field of competition.
A pair of earrors and a retail glass that was covered to two little stripes that became the biggest enemy of memory fighters.
I went to the same competition that I had a year earlier.
and I was hollow to participate in this just as a journalist experiment.
It could be a nice pilog for my research.
The problem was that this experiment didn't work out like a plan.
I won the competition, which is really not supposed to have been.
It was nice to have a memorable and phone numbers and shopping lists, but that's not what I wanted to get.
These are just tricks.
Evolution works because they're setting up a few simple ideas about how our brains work.
You don't have to build memory palace or you have to navigate your card coverage to get your memory working.
We often talk about people with good memory as if it's a very special talent, but it's not true.
Good memory is training.
We're really curious about things better when we look at them.
We remember when we're being committed.
We're thinking, well, we have the opportunity to have to remember why information and experience are meaningful to us, why they have released and ev emerge, which is to convert them into something that is sensible to us, if we can turn the name back into the job, if we can turn the Baker into the Baker.
The memory palace, these brainstores, they're all shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even really shifting.
They work because they're forceing us.
They force us to be processed and be aware in a way that we don't usually have.
But it's not shortcut.
This is how things are enhanced.
And one of the things that I wanted to leave you with, something I was going to give you, was the man who remembers his memory problem, the man who remembers his memory problem.
How much are we ready to lose from our ethnage, to losing our lives by permanently, rather than the people who are talking to us, rather than who are talking to us, rather than who are talking to us about attention, how much are we ready to lose because we're so lazy and want to remember the experience of being so bad?
I learned that memory, in each of us, has incredible capacity.
If we want to live a life-signing life, we need to be the person who doesn't remember.
Thank you.
At the age of 27, I had a work on a tenant company for a more even more hard-population job of teaching.
public schools at New York, I taught math classes for a seventh gradder.
Like every teacher, I did tests and exams.
I gave homework assignments.
When the works came back, I calculated notes.
So the I. ⁇ . is not the only difference between the best and the worst students.
I. ⁇ .'s one of my most powerful students were not stratosphere of ratio.
Some of my smartest kids did not do very well.
So that made me think.
Speaking out of the age seven years, in math, it's already difficult: Rational numbers, decimal numbers, the area of the parallelogram.
But these ideas are impossible not, I really felt that all my students would learn the fabric if they were working long and hard enough.
After a couple of years at school, I got to the conclusion that, in education, a much better understanding of students and learning from a perspective of motivation from a psychological perspective was from a psychological perspective.
What we find in education at best is the I. ⁇ .. But what if presumably is a school and life dependent on a lot more than the ability of a fast, and easy to learn?
So I left the classroom, and I made a degree of graduate education.
I started to investigate children and adults in all sorts of ways, all of a sudden, and I asked myself, who's successful and why?
My research team and I went to the West Point Military Fair.
We were trying to predict, what would our cast be education remain, and what's not.
We went to the national bookstore, trying to predict what kids would get their most farth-looking children.
We studied a young jumping teacher who was working in very difficult neighborhoods, and we asked those teachers, who were there at the end of the year of school years who were going to be able to teach their students to better their students,
We took partnerships with private companies, and we asked them to stop the selling workplace.
who most of them would make money.
In all these different contexts, one of the characteristic directions of a success came as a great indication.
It wasn't social intelligence.
It was not good look, physical health, and it wasn't I.
It was a bit of a issue.
Happiness is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
Highest assets are Steve.
Histributation, when you're thinking about a future plan, not just for a week or a month, but for years and really hard to work out this plan.
Malent assets are life like a marathon, not sprint.
I started teaching in public schools a while back in Chicago.
I've asked thousands of students at high school questionnaire to fill out questionnaire questionnaire, and then I wait over a year to see who graduates.
It showed that children who were more likely to have higher strains, even when I was a measurable properties, even when I was a measurable properties of family income, results at a standardized test, even how they felt in school.
So people have assistance, not only in the West Point, but also in the bookstore, but also in school, especially for children with abolon.
The most scariest part about this issue is that we know that science so little knows how to build it so little.
So, every day, my parents ask me, "How do we support the children's content in the children?"
How do I teach children a solid work ethic?
How do I motivate her for distance?"
The honest answer: I don't know.
But what I know is, is that talent alone doesn't have a storage out of the world.
Our data shows that a lot of talented people of their dedicated people just don't stay to it.
In fact, diameter assets are ordinarily not talented, but correlated with talent.
As far as the best idea I've heard about this is about the value of the transit, it's the so-called growth minds.
This is a idea that was built at Stanford University, and it's called the conviction that the skill has not been set, but it can change your commitment, it can change your commitment.
Dr. Dweck has shown that kids when they read about brains and they learn how to change the brain, how it grows in the case of the world, and what they believe is that failure is a permanent condition, because they don't believe failure.
The growth mindset is a great idea for building diameter.
But we need more.
Here, I just want to end with my comments, because we're already so far.
This is the work that lies in front of us.
We need to keep our best ideas and strongest intuitions.
We have to measure if we're successful. We have to fail, to have injured, to have injured lessons, to learn lessons from the front.
In other words, we need to have a need for more persistence in giving our children more powerful.
Thank you.
At the center of my work, the connection of thinking about the relationship to our shared life and being part of the environment, is that architecture comes from the natural, regulatory conditions, and traditions.
Today, I've got an example of that, and I've got a lot of new projects in it.
The two projects are in the emerging markets, one in Ethiopia and one in Tunisia.
What they also do is, in fact, that the different analysis of different perspectives are going to be a substantially important part of the final architecture.
The first example, when I started an invitation, started to design a more high-story shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Abbeba.
And this is the kind of buildings that, my team and me, were being shown to be a sample of what we should be designing.
First of all, I thought I wanted to run away.
And after seeing these buildings -- and there are many of them in the town -- we realized that they have three key features.
One is, these buildings are almost empty because they harbor very large shops in which people can't afford to buy stuff.
Second, they need an enormous amount of energy, because the surfaces are made out of glass, which heat within the insides, and then you need a lot of refrigeration.
In a city that shouldn't have them, because they have a lot of Mildes weather, like 20 to 25 degrees, they're in a city that's between 20 to 25 degrees.
And third, their image has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
This is a place with such rich culture and tradition.
And also, really, my first Ethiopia was really fascinated by the old market with this kind of  ⁇ -the, where thousands of people go and shopping and shopping on a daily shopping with small retailers.
It also has this idea of public space, which is using the outside of the outside to create activity.
So I thought, that's exactly what I want to create, not a shopping mall.
But the question was how to design a more story-driven, contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge we did when we looked at the property, because it's in a real growth zone where most of the buildings that you see in the picture, they haven't been there yet.
It's also two parallel roads that have no connection with hundreds of meters.
The first thing we did was, we created a connection between these two streets, and they put all the way down the hallway of the building.
This is what's happening in an appropriate assignment, which is that a habits, in the building, is able to create protection, which protects its own form itself from the sun and the rain.
And in order to have this halt, we placeed the idea of a market with little shops, with little shops, who are changing the shape of the Hole.
I also thought, how do we close the building?
I really wanted to find a solution that reacts to the local climate conditions.
I started thinking about textiles, like a bunk of concrete that was in the air, and the light, but in a more informed form.
Then I inspired these beautiful buttons on the clothes that Ethiopian women were inspired.
They have the properties of a fractal geometry, and that helped me design the entire facade.
We're building this out with these small prior components, the windows, the windows that let the air and light the way into the building.
And it's filled with these little, colored glasses that use light from the house to light the building at night.
It was not the first time they'd actually start to convince the contractors, because they thought, "That's not shopping mall. We didn't ordinarily h orders."
But then we all recognize that this idea of the market is a lot more profitable than the idea of a shopping mall, because they can basically sell more shops.
And the idea of facade was a lot, much cheaper, not just because of materials as they needed glass, but also because we needed no air conditioning.
So we created some cost-effective savings that we used to realize the project.
The first implement was to think about how we could make the building tenario, in a city, that almost every day has electricity.
We created a valuable contribution by turning solar panels on the roof.
These were the panels that we made, we made the roof as a new public space with tenthal nights and bares that made this urban oasis.
These roof roofs are gathering the water again in the sanitation pad.
Hopefully, at the beginning of the next year, because we've constructed constructions to the fifth floor, the thing that's already done.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and institutions in Tunis.
So to run a large project, the largest project I've ever designed, I had to really understand the city of Tunis, but also the environment, and the tradition and culture.
And I would pay specifically to this analysis when I was particularly on the medina, which is the 1,000-year-old structure that was captured by a wall of 12 gates, and pretty much connected lines.
When I went to the site, the first step, the existing road, was to extend the existing roads, with similar size and traits like the one in Barcelona and in other European cities, with these courts.
So, in addition to that, we chose some strategic dots to the concept of these gates and they connected them to straight lines, and that changed the original pattern.
The last step was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, as an integral part of the master plan.
What is the best edition in a media in a media that is a apartment?
This is north-south, because of its temperature voiceless, between the two of these households that are being created and natural vapor.
So we put a pattern out there, that's that most apartments are perfectly set in this direction.
And this is the result, it's almost like a combination of a European blocks and the Arab town.
There are the bloom with courts, and the ground floor is there for these whole connections to pedestrian pathways.
It also performs the local scripts that capture higher density in the upper floor and lower density in the ground.
It also enhances theoretical concept.
And so the volume has this connective form that's proved to be able to do through three different houses, and also a lot of the neighborhood, and in a very dense neighborhood, where you have these interior, and you have three different facilities, like a more fatalities, and a kindergarten is a kindergarten to the ground, and there is a series of business that activity to the ground floor.
The roof, my favorite place, of course, is the same in this project, almost back to the building.
And where the neighbors can go and come together and do things like a two-knel, you'll get a two-known walk in the morning, you'll be riding a building for the other spin.
These two examples have a shared approach to designing.
They're in the emerging markets, where you can literally see cities growing.
In these cities, the effect of architecture in this today, and future life, people are living the local communities as fast as the buildings are growing as the building.
And so, from this reason, it's important to me that architecture is an underlying solutions that really enhances the relationship between community and the environment, and that focuses on a lot of time, nature and human beings.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trust, and I want to remind you about trust in the popular belief.
They're so ubiquitous, they have become the cliche.
I think that is what I think is three.
First of all, trust is a lot of people who are in the back, a lot of them are going to be a lot of them.
Then one goal: We need to trust more.
And one of the assignments is to rebuild trust.
I believe that the claim that we have the target and the job to do is to be based on the wrong belief.
So I want to tell you another story about an proposition, a goal, a problem that a lot better approaches for the offering.
Firstly, the claim: Why people think that trust has gone down?
And when I really talk about the current knowledge of this, I don't know the answer.
Maybe it has taken it to some activities or institutions and other people might be gained.
I don't have the idea.
But I can of course look at the surveys that are supposed to be the source for belief that the trust has gone down.
If you look at opinion surveys over a period of time, there's not a lot of evidence for it.
Suppose the people who were being mistrusted 20 years ago became mostly journalists and politicians, still mistrusted.
And the people who used to familiarize the 20 years ago are still very familiar: judge, nurses.
We have another one of them. By the way, the average citizens are almost in the middle.
But is that a good proof?
Interpower polls -- all of them -- opinions.
What could they do?
So they're looking at a generalized position of people when they're asked to ask certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now if you ask someone, do they trust vegable trachors?
Do you trust fish dealers?
Do you trust primary school teachers?
You'd probably wonder, "What exactly is a lot?"
And that would be a sensible response.
And if you understand the answer to that, you might say, "I trust some of them, but not."
Voiled.
In short, we're trying to get trust in our short lives, in different ways.
We don't really want to leave any official or institutional facility in an official or institutional institution.
So, I could say that I had a certain to tell you that I was familiar with a  ⁇ unclear ⁇ , which first of all, I'd been to the school teacher, and I'd been to the school bus, and I wouldn't let them drive the school bus.
Maybe I just happen to know that she doesn't drive a good car.
I trust that my most vibrant friend is a conversation to keep the building, but not to be aware that she's a secret.
Simple.
This is how we know from our daily life, how different trust can be, but why do we inflate that knowledge if we think about trust?
The surveys give a real shit on the real trust level because they ignore the common sense of trust, you know, that you are doing in trust.
Second, we get to the goal.
The goal is to trust more.
Honestly, I think, the target is stupid.
That's not going to be a target.
I would try to trust the trustworthy more, not the trust, but not.
I even premblely re trusted to trust trustworthy.
And those, for example, had their savings, in the hands of a certain M. Madoff, who, like the way the name suggested, they got out of the dust, "made" -- "I'm looking at the dust," "I'm thinking, you know, a lot of trust.
"M trust," isn't a smart target in this life.
trusted and to use the trust, to be able to use it.
And you say, yeah, all right, what's the most important is not trust, but trustworthiness.
The trustworthiness of people can be estimated.
And to do that, we need to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
If we find a person in the field of the dealing issues, reliable, and honestly, we have a good reason to trust it, and then she's trustworthy.
But if the person is unreliable, probably not.
Some of my friends are competent, and honestly, I wouldn't let them pick it up because they're a great, but they're not forgetful.
I have friends who are very much trusted in their own competence, but they value them for a lot.
And I'm very happy that I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and reliable, but they're dishonest.
If I did, I haven't realized this.
But let's look for this: just trustworthiness, trustworthiness.
And trust is the response.
The trustworthiness is that we have to estimate. That's hard.
Over the past decades, we've been trying to set control systems in all sorts of institutions and experts, and we set them up to estimate their trustworthiness to make it easier to trust.
Many of these systems have the opposite effect.
They don't work in the way that they work.
A woman once said to me, "The problem is that the paperwork takes a long time to take the baby in the world."
Everywhere in our public realm, in our institutions, the problem is that, in a control system, trustworthiness must be stumbling, credibility and credibility, but the opposite.
It's people like leversing out their hard tasks, by going to the first tasks, by going into the first time.
I can give you any examples here.
So that's a lot of the goal.
The goal is more trustworthiness, and it will be difficult if we want to be trusted and want to communicate that other people, and if we want to estimate, whether other people, or officials, are trusted or politicians, are trusted.
It's not easy. You have to estimate it. Simple reactions, or wood, it doesn't reach.
And now to the assignment.
This is when rebuilding the trust, it's twisting, the thing that's correlating with.
Because it suggests that you and I have to rebuild trust.
We can do that, of course, for ourselves.
We can win some trustworthiness.
So two people can get their trust in one another.
But ultimately, trust is characterized by being given by others.
You can't just build what others give you.
You have to have them give you a ground for trust.
So you have to be trusted.
Of course, that's because you don't usually have to carry all the people at the same time.
But you also need to make evidence that you are trustworthy.
How does this work?
This is happening every day, everywhere. ordinary people do it, officials, in a way, very effective.
Here's an easy commercial example.
The store I buy my socket, they leave me back, and they don't ask questions.
They'll take it back and give me the money, or some of the socks that they descend into the desire color.
So, this is great. I trust them because they showed me vulnerable.
There's an important moral being.
Part of the other side of the contrast is, it's a very good proof that you're trusted, and you're told your own belief.
So the goal we're going to have to really not recognize, basically, is not very difficult.
It's relationships between trusty people, and estimation of when and if the other is trustworthy.
So the moral of the story is to think much less about trust, or about beliefs, about attributes to the trust that I think are being found out, and a lot more about trustworthiness, and how to use people's adequate, useful and simple evidence of trustworthiness.
Thank you.
You know, the best part of the father for me is the films that I can look at.
I love looking at my own favorite movies with my children, when my daughter was four years old, we looked at "The Corizic Celler by Oz."
And it was not that movie for months anymore.
Their favorite character was, of course, Glinda.
So she had a good excuse to carry a glutor dress, and wearing a magic wandering around.
But if you look at this movie, you can see how extraordinary it actually is.
We live in today, and we raise our children in some kind of spectacular child-friending industry in the same way.
But "The Elizer magician Oz was different."
He didn't start this trend.
It took 40 years for this trend, and it took me 40 years, interestingly -- another movie where a guy from metal and a guy with a lot of furiously rescued a girl, as they were doing the wake of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
Exactly.
Well, there is a big difference between these two movies, even multiple big differences between "The Corporary Corporary Oz," and all the films that we're looking at today.
First of all, in "The Corporary Corporation," it's very little violence.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, as well as the apple trees.
But I think, if "The magician wizard had been produced in Oz current, the magician would have been said, you're the Ezueline Retteer, that's who became a prophete.
Use your magical shoes to defeat the computers, the wages of the evil wave attenuation of the West."
But that's not happening.
Another thing that I find in "The Empire of Ocean" is very unique, is that the heroic and siendful characters are female.
That is the first time I noticed when I was talking to my daughter, "Star Wars," which was the way I was going, and the situation was different.
At that point, I had a son,
He was three years old at the time.
He hadn't invited me to that chat, and he was still too young.
But he was the second child, and he was far less than the sister of his sister.
So he's going to go around, and he's a movie that's been tracking the movie a duck his mother and, I don't think he understood what was going on, but he got really sure, he got it really, really hard.
And I asked myself what he did.
Did they stop it, that it's about courage, perseverance, loyalty?
Did it stop to have a army that wives the government to cut the government?
And he stands to us, that there is only boys in the universe, and of course, Tunt Bu and, of course, that princess, but during the time, it's only waiting for the hero to thank the coal and a eyes to thank it for the sake of the universe, to thank it for the sake of the universe, what has it been that he's been born with?
Compare that to "The Coriz of Oz" in 1939.
How do Dorothy make her film a good end?
By staying in all the people and are a leader.
That's the kind of world I'd prefer to raise my children -- oz, or? -- and not in the world, in which guys, Klean, they are fighting what they're trying to raise.
Why is there so much power -- big power -- in the movies that it's for, and so few yellow bricks, and so there's a few yellow bricks?
There's a lot of good literature about the impact, the movies of violent boys and girls, and they should be read. It's very good.
But I haven't read so much about how boys interact with this influence.
I know from my own experience that Pinnouria did not abandon the adequate forefast that I could have used to, in order to find through the world of adults, in girls and boys.
I think there was this moment with the first kiss when I really expected the whole thing to start, because it's like a movie, right?
I finished my mission, I picked the girl.
Why do you have it?
I don't know what to do.
The films are very referred to overturning the evil, and the reward, and there's not much room for other relationships and other travels.
It almost acts as if you're a sophisticated animal, and if you're a girl, you want to bring better his warbo-stairs.
There's lots of these, lots ofile, and I'm going to defend the Disney Print Sincess in front of each of you.
But they're giving an message to the boys, that the boys are not the audience's target.
They're a great job to teach girls how to use the patriarch for the girl, but they don't necessarily show the boys, how they should against the patriarch.
There are no models for them.
There's a couple of grandiose women who are writing new stories for our children, and so three-dimensional and wonderful, and catatamic, they are still war movies, they're still war movies.
And most successful studio of all time, of course, is a classic after another, and every single one of them is about the journey of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or by a man and his son, or two men who are raised a little girl.
Until, many of you think that year, that year, when she finally started the movie, "Merida -- leathering the Higgs."
I'm going to recommend you all to them. He's called the Internet.
Do you remember what the critic said, "Merativeida" came out?
"Ah, I can't believe Pixar did a princess movie."
He's very good. So you won't keep from it.
But how no one had done this films at the Bank test.
I don't know if you've heard about it.
It hasn't been so real and released, and we're going to start today, but maybe we're going to start a movement.
Alison Banken is a comic bookaut, and in the middle of the 80s, he was taken this conversation, which was to be a friend of the films that they had seen, and they had this.
It's very simple. There are just three questions you need to ask: Is there more than a character in the movie that's female and saying something?
Try to meet that requirement.
And do these women, at some point, speak out?
And is it about their entertainment about something different than the guys they like them in?
Globed? Thank you.
Thank you.
Two women, they exist, and talk about something.
That's what happens. I saw it, and yet I see it rarely in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, I went to the movies this week to see me, to see a very good movie, "Argo."
You remember? Lady, great things, great advance, a general coincidence, which is a great Hollywood movie.
He falls with walking into walking.
And I think that shouldn't be, because a lot of the movie -- I don't know if you saw it -- but a lot of the movie is in a message in a message, where men and women are hiding the hosts themselves during the host.
There are some good scenes that have men in this hide of fear, of fearful conversations, and the great moment that one of the actors is to kind of spher and to say, "You're going to go to bed, honey, honey?"
This is how some Hollywood looks.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, under the 100 most popular movies, do you think, how many of these, actually, female-pattern disease?
Elphin. It's not bad.
Not as many percent of the people who just have voted in Congress just have a lot of it, so that's good.
But there's a number that is bigger than that, and that's going to shake this space.
So last year the New York Times released a study that government did.
She says that.
One in five women in the United States admits that she was already sexually attached to the United States.
I don't think that the blame is the general entertainment culture.
I don't think children are doing anything with it.
I don't think that music video and pornography have something to do with it, but something that is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, it's one of the things that I hear is a lot of sexuality.
Who are these guys? What do they learn?
What can't learn to learn?
Heroes the story to you, is that it's the job of a male hero to defeat the rogue with violence, and then to pick up the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not?
Do we have to take this story?
You know, as a parent, a parent, who the privilege of raise a daughter is, just like those of you who do the same, we find this world and these statistics are very alarming and we want to prepare them for preparers.
We have means we have resources like "Mids punch" and we're hoping that this will help, but I'll also wonder if girl powers it, at the same time, taking active or passing on our sons, teaching our sons to keep their "dy".
The Netflix queen is a means that we can do something very important, and I'm talking to the fathers, and I'm going to talk to you in this room.
I think we really need to put our sons simply a new definition of masculinity.
The definition of masculinity is already changing.
They read how the New Economy changed the roles of homemaky and bulch earners.
They're being made all through one another.
Our sons have to have a way to address a new relationship with each other, and I think we really need to have to find a way to make a new relationship with the sisters, and they're going to have to be familiar and they're being respected and standing on their side, and they're going to be giving up against the really bad guys who are the women.
I think we should look for movies called the Netflix, which is the gut-to-take-boo-boob, and look for the heroics, and look for the heroics, who are the real courage, and get our sons to be identified, and say, "I want to stand on your side because, "I want to stand on your side," because they're going to stand on their side.
When I asked my daughter, who was her favorite character in "Star Wars," you know what she said?
Bi-Wan.
Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What do they have in common?
Maybe it's not just the shiny dress.
And I think these two figures are experts.
So these are the two characters in the movie that more than all of us have heard about, and their knowledge to share with other people to help them learn their potential.
And then they are leaders.
I like this kind of job for my daughter, and I like this kind of job for my son.
I want more tasks like this.
I want to give away less tasks, in my son, and I want to tell you about it, "Toch and struggle," and "sign a team to help a team, a woman, to help others be better, to help others, to be better people, to be better people, like the magic of Oz.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the story of one of the kids of a little toddler.
I don't know his name, but his story.
He lives in a small village in the south of Somalias.
His village is near Mogadianu.
The drought created this village and the manual hungertod.
When there was nothing that was holding him, he left his village, and he was going to the city, in this case, Mogadicu, the capital of Somalias.
When it comes to it, there's no possibility, no work, no out.
And he's getting a tent camp outside of Mogadian.
It may well be a year, but it's nothing.
One day, he's approached by a man who invites him to lunch, and then to dinner, after breakfast.
He makes this dynamic group of young people, and they give him an opportunity.
He gets some money to buy new clothes and send money to his family home.
So, this young woman is presented.
Eventually, he marriages.
He starts a new life.
His life has a sense.
On a beautiful day in Mogadicu, azurb blue sky, a car bombings in the air.
This Embedded city kids with taddraws was suicide, bombing, and this dynamic group of young people was al Shabaab, a terrorist organization, with connection to al  ⁇ aeda.
How was the history of a child who was just trying to end up in the town with the big city of the city that he blowed out, that he blow themselves up?
He had wait.
He'd wait for a opportunity to go on the future, on a road, and it was the first opportunity that he would be asked.
It was the first thing that drives him out of a state we called "Waithod."
And the story repeats itself into the urban areas around the world.
It's the story of the unenfused, unemployed urban youth that in Johannesburg and London, is triggered in the riots and for something else as a Waithodes.
Young people are promising the city, of their grandfadds, of possibilities, possibilities, wealth, but young people not have any proportion of their cities.
Some of the time, it's adolescents who suffer from high unemployment.
In 2030, three out of five people are younger than 18 years of age in cities.
If we don't involve young people into the growth of cities, if we don't have the possibilities, then they'll have the rise to terrorism, the violence, the violence and the city to Gang 2.0.
In my birth town, Mogadicu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
70 percent of them don't have work, don't go to school.
They actually don't do anything.
Last month, I went to Mogadian, and I went to the Madina hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing outside this wounded hospital and saying, what if I had gone from here to here?
What if I had to have the same state of "Waithod" forced?
Would I be terrorist?
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to answer.
And the reason for my insent this month in Mogadicu was actually a vitalization of a venture and entrepreneur.
I brought about 90 young Sali leaders.
We sat down and made a brainstorming to the biggest challenges of their town.
In the room, a young man, he was a young man.
He went to visit the University of Mogadicu and graduated there.
There was no work, no possibilities.
I remember he told me that he who had a university degree and was frustrated by unemployed and frustrated a target, he was a member of al-Shabaab and other terror organizations.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes another run.
In Mogadicu, the biggest obstacles to B, to come from A to B, are the roads.
Twenty-three-five years of civil war, the motorcycle was completely broken, so the motorcycle is the best way to be transported.
Eden recognized the opportunity and took it.
He actually made a motorcycle shop.
He started rejecting motorbikes at local locals that otherwise would not afford to be.
With his family and friends, he bought 10 motorbikes and he dreamed of being in his business, in the next three years, to extend some hundredths of a hundred.
How is this story of others going?
What's the difference?
I think it's its ability to recognize and use a new opportunity.
It is the entrepreneurial tour, and I believe that entrepreneurs can be the most effective means of "Waithod" for entrepreneurs.
It empowers young people to create the economic chances that they are looking for so desperate.
You can teach young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who was one of my meeting at one of my meeting: Mohammed Mohamo, a florist.
He helped me to train the entrepreneur ventilation of a young age to be able to educate and to educate, how to innovate, how to innovate and entrepreneurship.
He is the first florist that was in the Mogadicu for 22 years, and until recently, before Mohamed there was, you used to use artificial strains that had a ship from abroad when you wanted to have flowers on your wedding.
When you asked someone, "When you saw the last time you saw the new flowers?" And then the answer was, "No, that was the answer of the civil war."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He founded a landscape garden by flowers.
He started a plantation out of Mogadicus, and started growing tulips and libraries, which, as he said, could survive in the Mogadicus.
He started to resolve wedding flowers, a built private garden and staff and businesses around the city, and he's working on the design of the first public park in Mogadia for 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mogadicu.
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together and, as he say, the beautiful thing of life.
And it's only by the edge of the two: he doesn't grow roles because they need too much water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in this room, Mohammed has had a great impact on the other young people in the room.
They never really had a thought about starting a business.
They thought about working for an NGO or for government, but this story, of his innovation, had a powerful effect on them.
He encouraged her to look at her city as a place of opportunity.
And he inserted that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could make change.
At the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges of their town.
They had entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.
Now, the inspiration of young people and the creation of a entrepreneur is a really big step, but young people need capital to take their ideas into action.
They need experts and supporters to lead them to develop their business, and start to build their business.
If you bring young people with the resources they need, in linking them, give them the support they need to be able to create ideas and to create catalysts for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneur is more than just the foundation of a business.
It's about creating social effects.
Mohamed is not selling flowers.
And I think he's selling hope.
His so-called "feel spark," if it's built, is to change people's minds in the way that people are doing it.
Eachen has hired street kids who help them to rent and keep the motorbikes.
He gave them an opportunity to come out of the paralyzed state of "Waithod".
And these young companies have huge impact on their cities.
So my proposition is, let young people go into entrepreneurs, have them nurture their own innovations, and you'll have more stories about flowers and "feels sparks," rather than "with" or "waith".
Thank you.
When I was a childhood in Maine, it was one of my favorite parts of the world to look for sandd dollars, because my parents were saying, "That's happiness.
But these mussels are hard to find.
They are rehearsed by sand, hardly see.
But after a certain time, I had developed a routine.
I started to see shapes, and patterns that help me collect them.
This evolved into a passion for me to find things, for the past, and the archeology.
And when I started to study Egypt, I realized that vision doesn't really work with my merely eyebrow.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Egypt came to a hundred miles, along the nails, and then made me look at the size of the niled sand due to the size of cities.
And that led me to use satellite imagery.
I had to look at the past in a way to draw the past in a map.
I want to show you how we see for example differently when we use infra-racial.
This is a sites that are delicious in Egyptian delta called Mende.
And the sites seems to be visible, but if you use infra-raun, you're working with the color, you're working with the color, and you're going to be able to see all of light.
What you see here is the chemicals of the landscape of materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians.
What I'd like to share with you today is how we used satellite data to find an old-fashioned city that had the name of Into-taui, and was shipping for thousands of years.
Intai was the capital of Egypt, for over four hundred years, in an epoch called the Old Epche named Rich, about four thousand years ago.
The sites in the Egyptian al-Fayyum and it's significant, because in the middle, there's a great Renaissance for Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Egyptologists have always known that the sites of Inti somewhere are somewhere in the Pyramids, built by the two kings, shown here by the red circles, but somewhere in this massive buzzing we are in this massive buzzing.
This area is huge -- the land is four times three miles.
Early on the Nil right, I got down the Nil directly from Inti, and as the result of the West, they shut down to the West, they hated the city.
So how do you actually find an ara city in thisarted countryhip.
It happened to be able to find the equivalent of finding the needle in ha ha ha ha ha ham, blindfolded and baseball gloves.
So, we used NASA's typography to create a map of the landscape, so we could actually see NASA's map of the easy variation.
where the Nelsi used to be.
But you see more, and this is very interesting, this light-shaped area, with the circle, with the circle, which actually started as a possible position for the city of Inti.
So we worked with Egyptian scientists to do the cooling of the hill, which you can see here.
This is like hubs of ice, rather than the shields, of course, looking at climate change, you see layers of layers that display human population.
depth of five meters, under a thick of a thick of mud, we found a dense layer of clay.
This shows that in this position of the Intiety-natural position for Intaui, in five meters, we can find a hundred years of hidden shots going back to the Middle Empire, the facts, in which we think the existence of Inti-takehold.
And we found that we founded -- Karnol,  ⁇ unclear ⁇ , quarterz Achat -- and that shows that there's a jeweler.
This may not look like a lot, but if you're looking at the most common rocks that jeweled in the mid-20s, you'll find these rocks.
So we found a dense layer of residents that went back down to the Midwerer.
We also found evidence for a jewelry to have a high-powered society, which is to be a very important city.
And there's no Itland yet to go back, but we'll go back to these site, to draw a map.
What's more important is, we have a lot of cubicle promotions for young Egyptians that are being trained in this satellite technology so they can make the same big discoveries.
So I wanted to close with my favorite quote from the Mid-Atlen Empire -- it was written in the city of Inti written a thousand years ago.
"Knowing the world is the largest of all calling."
There's nothing in the country."
TED was not founded in 1984 B.C.
Ideas came from, actually 1984 B.C. in an unit, in a not- long-term city, again.
And this is something that you can barely compare with the shuffle in the beach.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up on a calligraph in Taiwan as a daughter of a calligraph, my mother counted me with the beauty, the gesture, the form of the Chinese characters.
And since then, I've been fascinated by this incredible language.
But for an outside apparent, they seem to be as uncommon as the Great Wall of China.
For the past few years, I've been asked how I can so easily extend that wall to anyone who has interest in this complex language, and understand it, to learn how to value it.
I thought a new way to learn Chinese was useful, useful.
From the age of five on, I learned to draw every single stroke of the properties of the right sequence.
For the next 15 years, I learned new characters every day.
So we have only five minutes, a faster method, that would have a faster and simple solution.
A Chinese scholar scholar understands about 20,000 characters.
They just need 1,000 characters for an easy writing.
The most important 200 consent is to enable you to understand 40 percent of the literature -- enough to understand street signs, men and men, and the basic idea of certain kinds of Web pages or newspapers.
Today, I'm going to start with eight characters, and show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth to the wider as you can even go.
And this becomes a "Mund."
This man is walking.
"Mean."
If the Fewel Survey is a kid in high-potential arms, as if they're screaming, "Help ⁇  I'm on this," -- the characters are going to be in origin, but I like this idea. Take the fame, I like to take the picture, the one that bestly has a lot of the best.
This is a tree.
"Bam."
This is a "Berg."
The "Sonne."
The Mondor.
So, the sign of "Tur," looks like a salont from the wild West.
So these eight characters are radical.
They're the basic stick to form a wide variety of characters.
A human.
If there's another person behind it, then they'll find it pursue.
If it's more, it's two "distribution" and "cancer."
When a human has reached out to his arms, this person says, "It was so big."
The human in the mouth, he's like jail.
He's a prisoner, like Jonas at whale.
A tree is for a tree, two trees are available for a forest like this.
Three together stand for a forest.
Just put a plank under the tree, and you have a "Basis."
Make a mouth like this, it means "biotic."
Just because a tree is pretty idiotic.
Remember the fire?
Two fire is about each other.
Three fires are combining a lot of "Flam".
Just put the fire under two trees, it means "burn."
For us, the sun is the source of wealth.
Two suns together, they're giving back.
Three pieces together, they're "funken."
When the sun and the moon shine, it means "Hellness."
It can also be the next day for the next day.
The sun goes through the horizon, sunrise.
Play. Add in the door is stacked for the mirror.
put a mouth into the door, put it, "P asks questions."
Sound, he's pure. Is there anybody?
This person is going to slice from the door. "They're floody."
On the left is the "but".
Two women are saying, "Shut up."
Intent to three women, that's called "Ebred."
So we've now met 30 characters.
With this method, you can build the first eight radical 32 words.
The next group of eight characters is making another 32 words.
With a little bit of effort, you can learn a few hundred characters of the Chinese, like an eight-year Chinese child.
If we can draw these characters, we start to assemble them.
For example, we give mountain and fire a lot of the fireplace, so you can have a " volcan".
We know, Japan is the country of the rising sun.
This is the Sun, "U jump," because Japan is Japaneseast of the place.
A sun with the origin of the origin means Japanese.
A human being behind Japan?
One of them.
The characters are two mountains, they are confined to each other.
In the classic Chinese, it means "Exil," because Chinese emerge their political enemies in exile.
Today, "Exil" has become "miss."
A mouth saying, where it goes, "As" is what it says for "sushing."
This is the slide reminding me of the stage. Thank you.
